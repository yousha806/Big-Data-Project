Ecommerce Video Games Sales Project
As gaming enthusiasts, we know that the world of video games is constantly evolving, captivating millions of players worldwide. Today, I am thrilled to share with you some fascinating insights from my recent analysis of video game sales data.

📈 Data-Driven Insights: Data preparation and cleaning were the first steps in this exciting journey. With over 16,000 game titles in the dataset, I delved deep into the details, checking columns and info to ensure the data was workable. Eliminating null values in critical columns further refined our dataset, providing us with a clearer picture.

🔍 Exploring the Gaming Landscape: Our data visualization brought intriguing findings to light. From total game sales each year to a comparison between different regions, we witnessed trends, growth, and market preferences. The US emerged as the largest gaming market, followed by the EU and JP, each with its unique dynamics.

🎯 Targeting the Right Genre: Intrigued by the idea of joining the game industry, I set out to uncover the perfect genre for targeting the US market. The data pointed unmistakably towards Action and Shooter genres as the most popular choices. Players love a combination of action-packed adventures and thrilling shooting experiences, which inspired thoughts of creating an epic game like Overwatch!

🌟 Nintendo's Success Story in Japan: My analysis revealed Nintendo as the reigning champion in Japan, with their bestseller, Pokemon Red/Blue, having sold a staggering 10.22 million copies. Nintendo's focus on Role-Playing and Platform genres has undoubtedly contributed to their resounding success.

🎮 The Gaming Trends Over Time: A close look at game trends between 2008-2015 for Racing and Shooter genres provided invaluable insights. Racing games experienced fluctuating sales, while Shooter games demonstrated consistent performance.

🚀 Embracing the Power of Data: Data is the driving force behind success in the gaming industry. These insights reveal the immense potential of harnessing data to make informed decisions, create captivating games, and shape the future of gaming.
